      title: 'My Research' # ðŸ“š
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My reseach focus can be summarized as _effects of higher-level
        information on phonetic realizations_. Higher-level information such as
        morphology, syntax, and especially semantics can systematically influence how
        words and segments are phonetically realized.

        In my PhD project, I found that frequency effects on articulatory
        realizations (i.e., tongue positions) were modulated by morphological structure
        of words, and that such modulation effects of morphology could be explained
        better in terms of semantics.

        Developing this line of research, I am working on two research projects:
          1. Predicting word forms only from their meanings in German and Chinese.
          2. Modulation of morphological effects on phonetic realizations by
             phonetic identity of segments.

        Word forms, either coded in terms of their phonemic makeups or
        represented by their tongue movements, can be distinguished and predicted by
        their own semantic vectors, namely word-embeddings created by word2vec,
        fastText, contextualized embeddings using large language models, and etc.
        (Research project 1. above).

        Segments can be different in their realizations, according to
        higher-level information such as semantics and morphology. For example, affixes
        (e.g., _**un**do_) have been found to be longer than their corresponding
        non-affixal counterpart (e.g., _**un**cle_). Such effects, however, can affect
        different types of segments differently. Vowels are easier to lengthen and
        easily contribute to make speech more audible than stop consonants, for
        example. This research topic corresponds to the second research project above
        (2.).
