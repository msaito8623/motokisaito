## About Me
-->

I currently work as a postdoctoral researcher at University of Oldenburg (Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg) with Prof. Dr. Esther Ruigendijk. My primary research projects are:

1. Reduced (unclear) speech in second language learning

2. Perception of acoustically degraded signals by people of hearing loss and normal hearing
