Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Hugo Blox Builder's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/content-types/) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/).

Suffixes (e.g., _free*s*_) have been found to systematically vary in acoustic realizations (e.g., duration) and articulatory realizations (e.g., tongue position) both, compared to pseudo-suffixes (e.g., _free*ze*_). In the present study/talk, it was reporeted that this effect of morphological status on phonetic realizations can be modulated by vocality of the segment in question; A suffix can be longer in duration and more peripheral in tongue movements, compared to its corresponding pseudo-suffix, if it is made of a vowel (e.g., _Arbeit*er*_ "worker" vs. _Vat*er*_ "father"), but such differences are not observable if the suffix is made of a consonant (e.g., _er mach*t*_ "he makes" vs. _die Mach*t*_ "the power").
